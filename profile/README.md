# Seegmuller & Cie - Development

Welcome to the Seegmuller Development repository.

As part of its digital transformation, Seegmuller has created a software development centre in which we develop solutions for data governance, standardisation of IT tools, automation of recurring administrative and financial tasks, as well as support for various cross-functional IT-related projects.
